## Project History
> TRNKT started as a front-end only project during a coding bootcamp with General Assembly.  Having not yet been instructed in the ways of back-end development, we were tasked with creating a front-end application using React.js that interacted with a third-party API.  I decided to use the [OpenSea.io API](https://docs.opensea.io/reference) because I am interested in blockchain technology as well as art.

## Other Information
### What are NFT's?
#### A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable.  NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files. Access to any copy of the original file, however, is not restricted to the buyer of the NFT. While copies of these digital items are available for anyone to obtain, NFTs are tracked on blockchains to provide the owner with a proof of ownership that is separate from copyright.
