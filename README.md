#### A non-fungible token (NFT) is a digital file whose unique identity and ownership are verified on a blockchain.  Because they are unique items, artists are making digital art and selling it on the crypto market.  This app, 'Trinket', is a little toy designed to help you check out these little digital works of art.  NOTE:  The content is very unregulated and some is NSFW.

#### Click the randomize button to return some NFT's.  Click on any of them to view details, and click the purple button to add them to your Collection.  You can view you Collection at any time by clicking the button at the top of the navbar.
